# AAC-App

# Augmentative and Alternative Communication app, which we refer to as a Website Communication Board.
# Allows disabled users, specifically those with speech and language difficulties, an alternative form of communication using our deck of cards.
# These cards have an image and corresponding text which will be audibly displayed when the user selects the card. 
# Users select cards to form sentences that may be otherwise difficult for them to communicate.
